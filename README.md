# Credit Risk Classification Challenge

This repository contains my work for the 20th challenge of the UofT SCS edX Data Bootcamp.

## Background

This challenge uses a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a logistic regression model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Summary

This challenge was completed by separating the data into training and testing datasets, creating a logistic regression model using `sklearn` and fitting it with the training data. Predictions about borrowers' loan status were then made using the testing data. The model's performance was evaluated by looking at its balanced accuracy score and generating both a confusion matrix and a classification report. Overall, the model performed well, with an overall accuracy of 0.99, and was able to predict both healthy and high-risk loans with a high degree of accuracy and precision. A full breakdown of the analysis and its findings can be found in the `analysis_report.md` file in this repository.
